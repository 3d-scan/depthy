## How to help

The current state is a weekend hack. I'm currently refactoring the app to make it more modular,
so changes in API will be signifact. There's an inevitable design/ux overhaul down the pipeline.

There is a lot of stuff you can do with depthmaps. If you have ideas and you know how to code,
You already know how to help ;) I'm pretty lax on formalities, just make it work and at least 
try to follow conventions of the code...
